# My first knitr document

## Introduction  
**Markdown** is a very basic and easy-to-use syntax for styling written documents.
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.
You can even [link to FCSIT](http://www.fsktm.um.edu.my)! 

**Here is a code chunk and it prints the code and result.** 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

*Here is a code chunk but it only print the result.*
```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

Here is a code chunk but it doesn't print anything!!!
```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

Inline text computation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
time <-format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

### The current time is `r time`.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

This is the violin plot for the dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + geom_violin(trim=FALSE)
```

Another feature of R Markdown is the table:

Day          |Date
------------ |--------------
Monday       |23/5/2022
Tuesday      |24/5/2022
Wednesday    |25/5/2022
Thursday     |26/5/2022
Friday       |27/5/2022
Saturday     |28/5/2022
Sunday       |29/5/2022
